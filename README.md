# Keystroke-Pattern-Recognition
Our aim in this research is to explore the possibility of Identifying and Verifying
computer users by extracting and analyzing their keyboard typing patterns. We study
the performances of four novel architectures based on Na¨ıve Bayes and the L2 Norm
metric, both modeled to solve identification and verification tasks.
