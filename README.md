# Keystroke-Pattern-Recognition
The aim in this research is to explore the possibility of Identifying and Verifying
computer users by extracting and analyzing their keyboard typing patterns. We study
the performances of four novel architectures based on Naı̈ve Bayes and the L2 Norm
metric, both modeled to solve identification and verification tasks. In order to do
this, we explore a variety of data collection techniques and show how a mixture of the
considered ones leads to optimized results. We then evaluate all the resulting models by
computing the most commonly used metrics for each task, and comparing them with
those achieved by Giot, El-Abed and Rosenberger.
